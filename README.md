"We should never be rushed into maturity. The world would be a lot calmer if we were all given the chance to be who we needed to be, at the age when it was safest and easiest for us to be so."

### PREFACE <br/>
This document is not intended to be an academic, nor claims to be. It is also not an essay, a reflection, nor any kind of article in any classical sense. I am certainly not claiming to be an expert in any field, nor do I intend for this to be a rigorous analysis of Adult Baby / Diaper Lover (ABDL) spectra. It is a collection of insights discovered over time written into some cohesive format. It will be gradually updated and expanded over time as motivation and expressiveness strike, a live and continually evolving document.

I delve into various fields of knowledge to achieve some kind of broad metaphysical understanding of what it means to be ABDL. This is done for the sheer enjoyment of it‚ÄîI consider it a hobby, although I will note my academic background in applied science, applied psychology and applied philosophy. You could say I'm well into the application of knowledge, particularly as it relates to human experience and existence. "Wisdom" might be a word for it. I just so happen to have a penchant for ABDL not merely from my being ABDL, but also because it is often maligned and misunderstood, as well as an underexplored topic of the human condition. It is an [emic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic) piece of writing. 

On the whole, this document is simply an interdisciplinary view of ABDL, observing it from different angles and vantage points. New parts are added as inspiration strikes, so there may be some incongruency between parts. It's perhaps best to simultaneously take the document as a whole, whilst remaining mindful each section is largely its own standalone part, however I would encourage that you read it sequentially as presented. As such, it sits somewhere between forms of writing; an eclectic and integrative expos√©, an expressive metamodernist piece of work, deeply personal but also rationally objective. Take it for what it is.

The "Further Reading and References" items at the end are not strictly references mentioned in-text, although some will be. Rather they are pieces of inspiration that have gone into writing this document. Their information is scattered throughout. I have also included some Explanatory Notes with references-in-text that detract from the flow of the article, but were nonetheless curious bits of information and context that I found worthwhile to share.

You are welcome to reach out with any questions, comments, feedback, and critique, or to seek clarification. I love to discuss ideas, traverse deep concepts, and discover adventurous trails of knowledge to hike. 

Lastly, if nothing else, I hope reading what follows brings you some understanding and comfort in your ABDL life. I'm glad you're here. :)

Kindredly,

### INTRODUCTION <br/>
We all feel the void whether we acknowledge it or not. It's that deeply rooted sense that we are incomplete, not whole, something is amiss about ourselves, or there is simply "something wrong" that we cannot articulate. It is a feeling of existential malaise in knowing that, on some profound yet largely inaccessible level, perfection is unobtainable. It's what drives our behaviours, our desires, and incurs our motivation to act in specific ways in order to scontinually strive for our goals, or to minimise the discomfort of knowing that, irrespective of our awareness, we will never quite achieve exactly what we want, nor ever really have our needs fully met. It's the void of incompleteness that's *always* going to be there no matter what we do to try to fill it. It's the sometimes overwhelming hunch that, despite all the love we experience and connections we have, we ultimately feel alienated at the basal levels of our sense of Self.

Welcome to your subjective 'lack'. [note 1]

Given the nature of lack, it's either gonna drive us to act and continually strive to fulfil it, allowing us to full participate in life, or we succumb to it and end up depressed, and possibly prematurely deceased. I figure that's why it's important to lean into ABDL and make the most of it, make it work to better our lives, and not be ashamed. You cannot cut out the inherent-ness of it; ABDL is intrinsic, and we'd probably feel the void even more harshly if we didn't have ABDL as a defensive buffer.

This leans into that curious question of "What is going on in society that makes ABDL not just a thing that exists, but in fact proliferate and grow in numbers?" I think part of it is just many of us these days simply don't have fulfilling childhoods and the incident rate is increasing on that. That's not just a function of population growth, but also social factors like untreated intergenerational trauma, twisted and unhealthy societal values, lifestyles and materialism, and over-emphasis placed upon commodification that severely erode the more intrinsically fulfilling existential, aesthetic, and spiritual dimensions of being human. Thanks Capitalism!

The form of our lack these days is heavily influenced by the socioeconomic system we're in. ABDL can be viewed as a response to that system, attempting to balance out the repression and exploitation of the system we all experience just by simply existing within it. Capitalism tries to sell us on the idea that we can be wholly satisfied and fulfilled by purchasing goods ("Just got to have that new Diaper before everyone else!") and services (Mommy scams!) that promise to complete us, but will always fail in delivering on that promise because our lack is intrinsic and subjective, and cannot be patched by extrinsic, objective commodities.

In a manner of speaking, ABDL has us lean further into our own commodification by being so intensely materialist about the products we have to buy (Diapers, Oneseis, Toys, etc.) to mask our lack. Whereas, my focus is often on the opposite, meaning-making qualities that ABDL offers that can emancipate ourselves from these systems of subjugation, repression, oppression, commodification, exploitation and burnout.

There's a delightful irony in ABDL being a hypermaterialist culture whilst simultaneously liberating us from the hypermaterialist culture that incepted it in the first place. But that's only true provided ABDL is used, proactively, toward emancipatory ends and we do not fully give ourselves over to the capitalist materialism and sequent commodification of ourselves. Social media makes us very guilty of this, myself especially included.

Essentially, ABDL is ideally positioned as a means to continually explore and heal your Self, not as a means to superficially mask your sense of deficiency and defectiveness. However, this requires deep acknowledgement of our lack and how it percolates upward into our everyday lives. This is why I'm into the meaning-making potential of ABDL because it is a way to grasp and understand our own lack and transmute it into something more empowering and emancipatory.

What follows below is hopefully a useful deconstruction and synthesis of ABDL leading toward a conceptual model for Meaning-Making Praxis that you can incoporate into your everyday ABDL playtime. By this, I mean changing how we *relate to ABDL* as a practice; not engaging with ABDL merely simply as a comfort or sexual release, but a tool to be employed for proactive and enriching Self-development across all dimension of our lives.

### ABDL: A Response to Alienation and Grief, and A Path to Self-Realisation <br/>
ABDL can be understood as a complex response to alienation.

Alienation is a psychological and emotional phenomenon rooted in a ‚Äúproblematic separation between subject and object.‚Äù It occurs when there is a separation between two things that inherently belong together. In the context we're interested in here: 
* The subject refers to the Self, typically an individual, e.g. Oneself. 
* The object can be a thing, another person, or even oneself in some sense, e.g. Diaper, Parent, Friend, Teacher, Toy, or even Media. 

There is always a relation between subject and object. This relation becomes problematic when there is a disruption to the natural connection between subject and object, generally instituted by another person or other external power. The outcome is that the subject (Oneself) becomes alienated from the object of our desire.

Not every kind of separation is alienating; for example, if we are allowed to naturally ‚Äògrow out‚Äô of something and it's no longer of any especial interest. But when the separation causes distress and remains unresolved, it instils alienation via frustration, a sense of being stuck and unable to make progress toward, or otherwise unable to access the object of our desire.

Childhood is full of these moments of frustrating problematic separation‚Äîtraumas, losses, or unmet needs that leave lasting marks on our psyche. We tend to employ defence mechanisms to alleviate our discomfort of this alienation, which are useful short-term, but becoming outmoded as we mature, taking on a non-normative set of expression if the frustration is left unresolved too long.

Before continuing on, it is worth noting that alienation does not mean hopelessness or despair. As we'll discover, it instead creates space for:
* Authentic Connection ‚Äî relationships based on mutual recognition of lack, rather than the expectation of completeness, can be more genuine and meaningful.
* Solidarity ‚Äî recognizing that alienation is a universal condition can foster empathy and solidarity, rather than isolation or competition.
* Creativity and Growth ‚Äî the awareness of lack drives individuals to create, innovate, and explore new possibilities.

***
### Childhood Frustrations as Roots of ABDL <br/>
No one escapes childhood without some frustrations. For some, these unresolved moments lead to the development of ABDL. Some examples include, but are not limited to: 
* Being rushed through toilet training, leading to a loss of comfort or security.
* Having a favourite toy taken away, causing grief.
* Experiencing abuse or betrayal, breaking trust.
* Being told to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù or denied something deeply desired, repressing intrinsic needs. 

Each of these scenarios represents a ‚Äúproblematic separation‚Äù where the child is alienated from something they emotionally or developmentally needed and are steeped in shame as the control emotion [note 2]. Over time, these frustrations and shame, if unresolved, carry into adulthood and manifest in different ways. This includes ABDL and the thoughts, feelings and behaviours that constellate around it.

***
### ABDL as a Grief Response <br/>
At its core, ABDL can be seen as a form of grief. It‚Äôs an attempt to process the loss of innocence, comfort, or security that was taken or never fully experienced. This grief often leaves us feeling stuck in a moment of unresolved frustration, overwhelmed by conflicting emotions and interpretations of past experiences. Engaging in ABDL practices becomes a way to revisit these moments, to reclaim some sense of control or re-do what was lost. It‚Äôs not just a coping mechanism but also an expression of a deep, existential yearning to make sense of that loss and move forward.

For example, a child may be emotionally abandoned by a parent (problematic separation and loss), so the child learns to introject (defence mechanism) and becomes extremely compliant in order to win back their parent's affection. However, the problem is with the parent who does not resolve the situation, so the frustrated child remains stuck in the loss of their caregiver. When the child matures and, should that adult engage with ABDL, they may seek out a partner who fulfils an affectionate caregiver role in an ageplay scenario (revisiting), and will compromise themself by being overly-compliant to obtain and maintain such a person in their life. This can lend itself to toxic relationships, coercion and abuse, lack of self-esteem and self-respect, intense feelings of shame, anxiety, and depression, and may prevent the Self from adequately developing. 

***
### Why ABDL Becomes Obsessive or Fetishistic <br/>
ABDL often takes on a fetishistic quality because it revolves around an obsession with the ‚Äúlost object‚Äù‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs comfort, trust, innocence, diapers, caregiver, or something else. This 'lack' [note 1] establishes an internalised desire which can evolve into a fixation or fetish as we progress through puberty into adulthood. This fixation can sometimes distract from normative personal development, creating a sense of being stuck in the past [note 3], in association with the shame of not meeting societal expectations. However, it also offers an opportunity: these unresolved feelings highlight the untapped, psychologically rich material that is often potent in self-healing and integral to the meaning-making processes of our lives. This permits us not to just grow, but to explore and nurture ourselves, and to flourish individually, as well as part of a community. 

***
### ABDL as Entelechy: A Path to Self-Realisation <br/>
Here‚Äôs where the concept of entelechy comes in. Entelechy is about fulfilling one‚Äôs potential and achieving a more wholesome sense of self-realisation. This is distinct from self-actualisation, which attempts to find transcendent wholeness in one's being. However, 'wholeness' or 'becoming whole' is a misnomer [note 3]. What remains is for us to embrace our alienation, to delve into our childhood frustrations and problematic separations, to resolve the grief of our loss, and come to an elevated position of self-understanding through acknowledging, assessing and accepting‚Äî"realising"‚Äîexactly what has happened to our Self. 

ABDL, therefore, while rooted in alienation and grief, also serves a transformative function. It provides a means to: 
* Safely revisit and settle the frustrations of childhood.
* Reclaim agency over personal development and begin the journey toward Self-mastery [note 4].
* Integrate fragmented parts of the Self to form a more cohesive version of the Self.

Far from being merely a response to alienation and grief, ABDL can be utilised as a tool for immense personal growth. By engaging with these behaviours, individuals can move toward self-acceptance, authenticity, and emotional integration. It allows for a ‚Äúdo-over,‚Äù giving space to develop at one‚Äôs own pace and in a way that feels congruent with their inner needs. 

ABDL provides a pathway to convert unhealthy defence mechanisms into healthy sublimation, thus allowing us to heal, nudging us toward a more authentic, cohesive, and operable version of ourselves. Despite ABDL being generously tilted toward absolving ourselves from responsibility, its greatest irony is being one of the best tools we possess to better sculpt and fashion ourselves, eliciting us to take responsibility-of-Self in the most enticing manner possible: the Self-determination and Self-empowerment that comes with Self-mastery.

ABDL may begin as a response to pain and alienation, but it has the potential to become something much more profound. It‚Äôs a signal that we need to address unmet needs, reconcile unresolved grief, and re-align with our authentic selves. Through this process, ABDL can transform into a pathway for self-discovery, allowing individuals to flourish, embrace their individuality, and grow into the person they were always meant to be. 

This does not imply something forced (we do not need that childhood re-trigger). Ideally, we'd engage with the Self, others, and activities in a naturalistic way that is open to experiences and opportunities as they present and unfold, with deep curiosity, and a willingness to defy instituted systems that keep us repressed. ABDL offers the exact right kind of childlike wonder, idealism, and social rebellion requisite to our Self-mastery and emancipation. 

In this sense, ABDL is both a response to alienation and an entelechy; a way to fulfil the deepest human desire to create meaning from loss and move forward toward Self-realisation. To engage with ABDL is to explore our unlimited potentialities; an aesthetical and spiritual journey into the abyssal plains of the Self, and resurface with profoundly new perspectives about who we truly are as a person.

***
### ABDL Identity Erotics <br/>
How can one discover and recognise such perspectives within the Self? Looking at ABDL through the lens of "identity erotics" and "sensuous knowledge" can assist with engaging our ABDLness in a more wholistic and empowering way, giving us fresh perspective to think about the Self and its desires.

"Identity Erotics" is about breaking free from rigid ideas of who we're supposed to be. Instead of seeing the Self as fixed or defined by what it's not (e.g. "deviant is not normal"), identity is treated as something dynamic and Self-expressive (e.g. "self-determination is empowering"). When it comes to ABDL, this means seeing it not as something weird or wrong but as personal expression of who we are, shaped by our history, culture, and sensory preferences. ABDL isn't just "random," it's an evolved constellation of experiences and sequent behaviours, cognitions and emotions, an integral thread in the fabric of how we connect with ourselves and with others.

"Sensuous Knowledge" flips the script on how we think about knowledge. It's not just about facts or logic‚Äîit's about feelings, senses, and lived experiences. Sensuous Knowledge says that things like pleasure, touch, and desire can teach us about the world just as much as a textbook can. So, ABDL might be more than just a sexual quirk; it's a way of exploring and understanding the body, relationships, and even power dynamics in a way that feels intuitive and deeply personal.

Put these ideas together, and you distil a way to view ABDL as part of a larger perspective. It becomes a tool for Self-discovery and connection, rather than something to feel ashamed of. For example, think about the power dynamics available within ABDL, like "Caregiver" and "little". Instead of framing these as "who‚Äôs in charge," this perspective sees the dynamic as explorations of trust, vulnerability, and mutual energy. It‚Äôs about playing with those dynamics in a safe and consensual way, where the heart of the approach is curiosity and joy. 

ABDL, like all aspects of identity and desire, are part of what makes us human; merely one of the infinite permutations of how life can unfold. It's time we move past the stigma of ABDL and toward a deeper appreciation of ourselves and others by embracing it with openness and understanding. ABDL is a liberating way to think about attraction, intimacy and sexuality‚Äîand how that relates to the Self and to Others‚Äînot as something to hide but as something that can help us regain our sense of agency and allow us to flourish; to continually become better a version of our Self, and to help others do the same. 

In the context of Alienation and ABDL, Identity Erotics and Sensuous Knowledge opens space for authentic connection to thrive for our Self and Others, where we recognise the lack within all people, leading to our unifying desire to form genuine, warm, and validating connections. It allows us to foster empathy and solidarity for others, and arouses us into Self-compassion and compassion for Others. Through playing in this space, our creativity and growth is encouraged and nurtured, where no matter how you identify on ABDL spectra, there is incentive to create, innovate and explore new, untold possibilities and, ultimately, realise our sublime aesthetical, spiritual Self.

***
### ABDL Meaning-Making Praxis <br/>
It may be posited at this point that ABDL is, at its core, "Meaning-Making Praxis". Praxis here being a cyclical process of understanding Theory (e.g. a play idea to explore), putting it into Action (enacting said play), Reflexively assessing with a critical mindset upon the outcomes (aftercare; integration of the experience through meaning-making), and then closing the loop by seeking even greater understandings through follow-up Theory. 

ABDL is a wholistic practice that enables the continual adventuring into new domains of Self-enhancement, using your interiority to not just better project your Self externally, but also become a proactive interpreter of your experiences. Constructing your own narrative interpretations based on your individual personal experience‚Äîbeing your own "author"-ity‚Äîis what empowers you to infuse meaning and happiness into your life.

Here, "happiness" seems too rudimentary to fully capture those feelings of elation and serenity in moments where one encounters a truly profound insight into the Self, Others, or even life on the grandest scale. I'm talking of those distinct moments of Clarity one has when a personal potential is realised, a deeper layer of reality becomes implicitly understood, or a shared experience with another person 'just hits so perfectly' that one cannot help but extract from the experience a sense of wonderment and awe. To be an "author"-ity on your own life is to proactively extract a positively uplifting, spirited sense of contentment about who and what you are‚Äîan existential sense of meaning and purpose derived from your direct experiences. 

This is Eudaimonic Wellbeing, and it does not come naturally for many people. However, I believe it can be accessed via ABDL. To break it down, here are the three styles of "happiness" tied in with the cyclical Meaning-Making Praxis described above: 

1.  Hedonic (Theory) ‚Äî This concerns Physical and/or Consumerist pleasures that promote Subjective wellbeing. It is the idea that you can do something because the requisite resources are available to you. An example might be that sense of satisfaction when restocking your Diaper supply, or when your Caregiver prepares a cute little lunch for you. There is materiality involved. You may think to yourself, "I feel great about having [thing] and that I own it!" You are aware that you have available resources, so can promote your own Subjective wellbeing and jump into Action.

2.  Experiential (Action) ‚Äî This concerns Mental and Socioemotional fulfilment, and it promotes Psychological wellbeing. It may typified by the actual use and enjoyment of the material item that brought you the Hedonic pleasure. Here, you may experience a stimulating satisfaction upon wearing and using your Diaper, or the flavour sensation that is the Dino Nuggies and Apple Juice you've been provided with. You may think to yourself, "I feel great about engaging with these sensations and I'd like to do it again!" You've had an pleasurable experience that promotes your Psychological wellbeing, and which lays the foundation for Reflexivity.

3. Eudaimonic (Reflexive) ‚Äî This concerns Spiritual Meaning-Making, and promotes Existential wellbeing. Upon completing the Experiential event, you may derive a personal meaning from the experience which you further integrate into your sense of Self and, in the process, continue to author the meaningfulness of your life. You may have used your Diaper *because* it helps you master your own Shame. You enjoyed the Dino Nuggies and Apple Juice *because* you have a loving Caregiver in your life, and that is invaluable. You may think to yourself, "I feel great about being ABDL because it provides opportunity to have life-affirming experiences." You've further solidified your relationship with your Self (or Others, or life) and so you can promote your own Existential wellbeing.

From here, having obtained a more robust Self-understanding, you can cycle back to gathering those requisite resources (Theory) to repeat this Self-mastery process [note 4]. You may have discovered you simply love a particular style of headspace a certain Diaper print gives you (Theory), which would be an ideal launchpad to further delve into that aspect of your Self, so you purchase more of that Diaper (Action), use it and author additional narratives about your Self (Reflexivity). Perhaps you observed how secure you felt when your Caregiver provided for you without request (Theory), opening an opportunity for an aftercare conversation that helps elucidate further roleplay scenarios that bring about about that sensation (Action), and so supply life meaning and contentment (Reflexivity). These are just two examples among the infinite many, but hopefully they illustrate the process. 

Lastly, there is one critical item to keep in mind when undertaking this process: Honesty. If you cannot be honest with yourself and Others about how you feel and what you believe in, you will be misdirected from the very beginning and you will find yourself engaging inauthentically. This will incur Shame. Your formative attempts in your Meaning-Making Praxis may be structured around tackling Shame as the core emotion, which can only occur when you have acknowledged the emotion, and are willing to contend with its temporary discomfort. 

However, I will leave you with some hopeful motivation: it is through challenge that we personally grow and can make sense of our world, and so come to be better "author"-ities within it.

### The Dispersion of Sexual Fragments: ABDL as a Neosexuality

Sexuality has fragmented into countless niche identities and practices, a process called 'the dispersion of sexual fragments' (Sigusch, 1998). Historically, sexuality was viewed through a narrow lens‚Äîheterosexual, reproductive, and bound by traditional gender roles. The neosexual revolution dismantled this framework, allowing for the emergence of new sexual identities and expressions. ABDL is an example of how sexuality is no longer confined to genital-focused, orgasm-driven intercourse. Instead, it incorporates regression, role-playing, and non-genital pleasure as legitimate aspects of sexual experience. The act of wearing diapers or engaging in age regression as part of a sexual identity would have been unthinkable in earlier, rigidly defined sexual cultures, but in a world where sexuality has become more modular and fragmented, such practices are seen as another variation in an ever-growing sexual marketplace. Just as BDSM, Pups, and other fetishistic role-play have become mainstream, ABDL represents a highly specific yet increasingly culturally tolerated form of erotic play.

Inasmuch, sexuality has been commodified and normalised through media, technology, and commerce. The increasing availability of niche porn, online forums and socil media, and sex toys has made sexual interests that were once private or hidden more publicly visible and marketable. The online presence of ABDL communities, specialised products (adult-sized diapers, pacifiers, baby clothes, etc.), and even ABDL pornography demonstrates how market forces have embraced and sustained the fetish and its communities. Social media, forums and dedicated ABDL dating platforms contribute to the normalisation of ABDL within a niche consumer base, much like other fetish communities. The increasing availability of "fetish gear"‚Äîonce limited to underground subcultures‚Äîshows how capitalism has transformed sexual desire into something that can be bought, sold, and branded (again pointing toward Lacanian 'lack' and the commodificaton of desire), and invites a discussion about the 'prostetic substituion' of sexual gratification, where sexuality is enhanced or replaced by objects, technology, or role-play.

ABDL as neosexuality is fundamentally decoupled from instinctual reproductive functions. In the past, sex was tied to marriage and procreation, but neosexuality is more about pleasure, personal identity, and Self-expression. ABDL directly challenges the traditional idea of sex as an instinctual drive leading to reproduction. Instead, it is about psychosexual satisfaction through regression, power exchange, and emotional comfort rather than orgasm-centric intercourse, perhaps suggesting the over-representation of not just queer, but specifically asexual identities within the community in comparison to the general population. Many ABDL practitioners report that their interest is not necessarily about sexual gratification but about emotional security, stress relief, and comfort. This aligns with the idea that neosexuality is no longer just about eroticism but also about psychosocial fulfillment. The prosthetic substitution concept in neosexuality  fits ABDL well, as the interest often revolves around diapers, baby clothes, pacifiers, and other non-sexual objects that become central to sexual or emotional satisfaction.

Since neosexuality is shaped not just by biological drives but by social constructs, Self-invention, and identity play, this opens space for gender and sexual preferences to become more fluid, allowing individuals to experiment with roles and expressions outside traditional binaries. ABDL practices often involve role-playing and fluidity in identity, where individuals may temporarily adopt gender-neutral or gender-alternative personas regardless of their adult gender roles. This gender-play of ABDL reflects a broader trend in which gender differences are deconstructed in neosexuality, and often incorporates power exchange dynamics where individuals consensually adopt explicit roles.

Given that neosexuality is increasingly shaped by individual control, Self-improvement, and personal fulfillment rather than by societal norms, it therefore represents a private and Self-determined experience, allowing people to explore their desires in ways that are tailored to their personal needs. Many ABDL individuals describe their fetish as a form of Self-care, providing stress relief and an escape from adult responsibilities, reflecting the "therapeutic" aspect of neosexuality, where pleasure is intertwined with wholistic healing, recouperation, and personal well-being and vitality. The idea that people should optimise their sex lives by customising their experiences fits well with ABDL, as it is a highly individualised and Self-curated practice that meets specific psychological and Self-realisation needs.

ABDL is a manifestation of the neosexual revolution, where sexuality has been deconstructed, commodified, and reassembled into new forms. Like many other contemporary fetishes, ABDL reflects the detachment of sexuality from reproduction, the rise of prosthetic and non-genital sexuality, the role of commerce in shaping desire, and the increasing fluidity of gender and identity. Rather than being an anomaly, ABDL is a logical extension of modern sexual culture, in which personal desires, psychological comfort, and fetishistic play are embraced as valid aspects of sexual and emotional life. The neosexual revolution, in breaking down traditional sexuality, has made room for such identities to exist and even flourish, leading toward an enhanced coherence of individuality, personality, and community.

### ABDL is Social Rebellion

ABDL is social rebellion. Shirking the de facto norms of society, much like how being Ace, Autistic or ADHD is unconventional based on an arbitrary standard measure of being 'typical'. I reckon ABDL at its core is deeply rooted in Self-shame.

Shame is quite a powerful and universal human factor. Kids are shamed out of Diapers to conform to society's standards and become more independent or "Adult."

And even more shameful is wearing Diapers as an adult, as that implies some kind of deficiency or weakness of the Self.

Hence why choosing to wear Diapers is social rebellion; it's actively saying, "I will not conform, and I am stronger within myself for choosing this."

This points to why "potty rebel" is such a popular ABDL aesthetic. Or why wearing Diapers 24/7 is a lifestyle choice.

Or why there is such a supportive community around wearing Diapers, and it increasingly becoming one of the most visible and largest sub-cultures. It's a group of people who, for whatever reason, are empowered by the idea of choosing *not* to be disempowered by society.

ABDL is an opportunity to become a social rebel and authenticate one's Self. For some, it may be the only life item they can confidently say they made their own decision on. That we rally around an idea of non-conformity makes ABDL a truly valid and useful interest for the disempowered, the alternative, and those who feel maligned in a 'de facto-based' society; a society that is gradually becoming reductionist toward Selfhood in ways that invalidate the individual.

That is worth rebelling against.

### EXPLANATORY NOTES <br/>
1.  'Lack' here refers to the Lacanian interpretation of the term, and is often most closely associated with desire formation. Fundamentally, it is our symbolic dimension, i.e. our cognitive representation of things. At some time in our early life, we all experience some kind of loss, where the lost entity (diaper, innocence, caregiver, toy, lack of responsibility, etc.) becomes a symbolic representation in our mind, one which we intensely desire and can potentially fixate upon, developing into a fetish, kink or urge to regress toward. We humans are composed of a wide constellation of experiences that can create these symbolic representations, neatly linking to the idea that everyone's experience of ABDL is different, despite a comparable outcome (see note 2 on equifinality). It would appear that to be ABDL is to simply have the right constellation of 'lack', which given the fact we can find relatable people with relatable experiences in the ABDL community, supports the existence of common factors like specific childhood frustrations.

2.  This explains the 'equifinality' of ABDL; that there exists a multitude of various pathways where ABDL is the outcome. This is commonly expressed in the ABDL community when prompted, "How did you become ABDL?" and it becomes clear there is no one single reason. Yet shame seems to be an especially salient, connective theme. Shame tells us "I am wrong, I am unlovable, I am unworthy" because we couldn't meet some arbitrary expectation of another, or we did but against our own personal desire. In a more nefarious context, shame is the emotion commonly employed to manipulate, coerce or otherwise control another. But shame does have functional uses, e.g. moral and ethical compliance, justice / punitive systems... adherence to a toilet training regime. ;)  In any case, because of equifinality, a deconstruction of ABDL requires more of a thematic analysis rather than a causal approach. 

3.  Fetishistic fixation in adults tends to manifest as recurring, or ritualistic behaviour. It's as if we're yearning to revisit that fantasy-ideal in our minds, to relive the moment and have the ideal experience, clearing the underlying emotional blockage. Yet fantasy can never meet reality. So we constantly chase the unreal perfection of fantasy through an inadequate representation in reality. This gap is the 'lack', and is what keeps us ritualistically coming back to our fetishistic behaviours. We cannot wholly fulfil our deepest desires. Being unable to dismiss this 'lack' from our existence is the very reason we remain 'stuck' in our ABDLness. Just to play devil's advocate, consider this: If fantasy *could* meet reality, and you achieved your perfect ideal fantasy for real, would you not feel 'complete' or 'whole' and then quickly move onto the next big thing? This is typical human behaviour‚Äîwe achieve our goals and move onto the next. So it is through chasing the fantasy that we engage with ABDL and unlock its growth-oriented potentialities. Life is meant to be experienced as a journey, and if we reach our destination by achieving all our goals and fulfilling our deepest desires, becoming 'whole' and self-actualising, then what is left to live for? Think of ABDL like the game 'tag' you may have played in school: the whole point of the game is in the chase, that's the fun "play", not the accomplishment of tagging. And when a tag occurs, the game just keeps on going. 

4.  Self-mastery is about Shame as an emotion. So is Toilet Training, and playing with a toy we're "too old" or "not the right gender" for, as is the abuse we may have experienced, or the fact we have unmet needs from inadequate parenting. Childhood is the most formative time in our lives where we're learning our bodies, our roles, and society's expectations... it brings up a wealth of new and challenging emotions that shape our adult personality. Our infantile fantasies are now over and we have adult responsibilities and expectations to meet. Failing this process is also shameful. Irrespective of passing or failing other's expectations, we're hit with shame either way. The shame of ABDLness, therefore, is both the shame of failing to meeting Other's expectations, as well as the shame of passing Other's expectations but Self-repressing. This is why we must emancipate ourselves from shame. This can be achieved by directing our own Self-mastery process via Meaning-Making Praxis, becoming the primary authority within our own life.
